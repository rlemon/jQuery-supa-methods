So, your website looks fly, shouldn't your code too?

Now you can use all of your favorite jQuery methods with their supa-fly *supa* prefix.

**Need a demo?**  ***OK!***

`jQuery(selector).hide()` can now also be called from `jQuery(selector).supaHide()`  
***awesome!?!?!*** **I know!**

But it gets even better! (How you ask? well why don't I just tell you)
